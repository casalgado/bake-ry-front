If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.</li>
        <li><em>Push Notifications.</em> We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or certain features of the application(s). If you wish to opt out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings.</li>

    <p>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

    <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>

Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always perfectly precise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="cookies">4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
    
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>

    <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>

    <p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>

    <p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>

    <h2 id="ai">5. DO WE OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS?</h2>
    
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies.</em></p>

    <p>As part of our Services, we offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies (collectively, "AI Products"). These tools are designed to enhance your experience and provide you with innovative solutions. The terms in this Privacy Notice govern your use of the AI Products within our Services.</p>

    <h3>Use of AI Technologies</h3>
    <p>We provide the AI Products through third-party service providers ("AI Service Providers"), including <strong>Anthropic</strong> and <strong>OpenAI</strong>. As outlined in this Privacy Notice, your input, output, and personal information will be shared with and processed by these AI Service Providers to enable your use of our AI Products. You must not use the AI Products in any way that violates the terms or policies of any AI Service Provider.</p>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>

    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h2 id="info-safe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>

    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    <h2 id="info-minors">8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
    
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <strong>info@carsalhaz.com</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="privacy-rights">9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</em></p>

    <h3>Withdrawing your consent:</h3>
    <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>

    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

    <h3>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</h3>
    <p>You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>

    <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <strong>info@carsalhaz.com</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="dnt">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

    <h2 id="policy-updates">11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
    
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</em></p>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
