## Overview
Today's work focused on implementing `legalName` functionality across the bakery management system. This was a multi-step implementation that touched various parts of the application to support legal business names alongside display names.

- Updated styling in `custom-components.css`

**Why:**
- Added new features to bakery configuration system
- Improved UI components for better user experience
- Laid groundwork for legalName feature implementation

**Technical Details:**

- Enhanced form validation to handle both name types
- Updated user creation and editing workflows

### 3. System-wide legalName Implementation (Commit: 6d7ba05 - 10:25)
**What Changed:**
- Enhanced `ClientCell.vue` renderer to display legal names
- Updated `OrderForm.vue` to include legalName functionality
- Modified export utilities in `exportOrders.js`
- Updated order views: `ShowDelivery.vue`, `ShowOrders.vue`, `ShowPaymentDates.vue`

**Why:**
- Completed the legalName feature by implementing it across all client-facing components
- Ensured consistency in how legal names are displayed throughout the system
- Added export functionality for legal names in reports

**Technical Details:**
- ClientCell now shows legal names when available
- Export functions include legalName in data output
- Order views properly display legal business information
- Payment tracking includes legal name references

## Current State
- All user forms now support both display names and legal names
- Legal names are consistently displayed across the application
- Export functionality includes legal name data
- Bakery settings system has been enhanced with better UX

## Next Steps (Potential)
- Consider adding validation rules for legal names
- May need to update API endpoints if backend changes are required
- Review if legal names should be required fields for certain user types
- Test the complete flow from user creation to order export
